# IPR Stack Overview

The IPR Capability Stack is a modular operational architecture.

IPR acts as core reference.
Modules activate capabilities.
A decision gate verifies ex-ante.
Execution is conditional.

Execution allowed only if:
- IPR valid
- module active
- responsibility attributable
- trace exists
- time valid

Otherwise: fail-closed.
