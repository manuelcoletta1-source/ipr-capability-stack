# IPR-OPC
Operational Control Module

## Function
Enables or blocks actions before execution through an ex-ante verification gate.

## Role
Transforms IPR from passive identity to operational authorization system.

## Capabilities
- decision gate PASS/FAIL
- control over digital systems
- control over AI and automation
- governance of robotic systems (with IOSPACE)
- fail-closed enforcement

## Operational Flow
Action request → IPR check → OPC active → PASS or DENIED → Evidence produced.

## Without OPC
IPR remains verifiable but cannot govern execution.

## With OPC
IPR becomes an operational key.
